/**
 * This method is called immediately prior to socket:didAcceptNewSocket:.
 * It optionally allows a listening socket to specify the socketQueue for a new accepted socket.
 * If this method is not implemented, or returns NULL, the new accepted socket will create its own default queue.
 *
 * Since you cannot autorelease a dispatch_queue,
 * this method uses the "new" prefix in its name to specify that the returned queue has been retained.
 *
 * Thus you could do something like this in the implementation:
 * return dispatch_queue_create("MyQueue", NULL);
 *
 * If you are placing multiple sockets on the same queue,
 * then care should be taken to increment the retain count each time this method is invoked.
 *
 * For example, your implementation might look something like this:
 * dispatch_retain(myExistingQueue);
 * return myExistingQueue;
